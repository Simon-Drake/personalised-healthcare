# CLAUDE CODE PROMPT 5: Cross-Language Analysis - Injections

## Input files
- injection_protocols.csv
- injection_summary.md

## Task
Analyze injection protocols across all 8 languages to identify best practices, regional variations, and success predictors.

## Analysis Steps

### 1. Universal protocols vs regional variations
- **Prolotherapy**: What concentration appears most often? (12.5% vs 15% vs 25% dextrose)
- **PRP**: Japanese double-spin 3000rpm vs Western single-spin variable
- Document preparation differences that might explain outcome variations
- **Frequency**: Every 3 weeks vs every 4 weeks vs weekly (mesoterapia)

### 2. Success rate comparison
- Compile all reported success rates by protocol type
- **Prolotherapy**: What range of success rates is reported across all sources?
- **PRP**: What range of success rates is reported? Note variability.
- **Peptides**: What human vs animal data exists? What success rates reported?
- **Stem cells**: Regional availability and reported outcomes

### 3. Best protocols by evidence
Rank protocols by:
- Success rate
- Evidence quality
- Availability/accessibility
- Cost
- Identify "gold standard" vs "experimental"

### 4. Protocol differences explaining outcomes
- Examine differences in preparation methods between high-success and low-success protocols
- What variations exist in: activation protocols, injection techniques, frequency?
- Do certain methods correlate with better outcomes?

### 5. Combination protocols
- Which combinations are tested? (PRP + prolotherapy, prolotherapy + peptides)
- Synergistic effects documented?
- Sequential vs simultaneous administration

### 6. Wrist vs spine specificity
- Success rates differ by joint?
- Techniques differ by location?
- Post-surgical instability: special considerations?

### 7. Hypermobile population evidence
- What success rates are reported for hypermobile populations specifically?
- TMJ hypermobility studies: what outcomes reported?
- Shoulder hypermobility studies: what outcomes?
- EDS-specific protocols: do any exist? What results?

## Output file
**injection_analysis.md** with sections:
1. Best Protocols by Evidence (what to use first)
2. Regional Innovations (Japanese PRP method, Korean acupotomy, Latin mesoterapia)
3. Success Rate Summary (realistic expectations by protocol and condition)
4. Optimal Combinations (proven synergies)
5. Wrist-Specific Recommendations
6. Spine-Specific Recommendations
7. Hypermobile/Post-Surgical Considerations
