# CLAUDE CODE PROMPT 6: Cross-Language Analysis - Exercise

## Input files
- exercise_protocols.csv
- exercise_summary.md

## Task
Analyze exercise protocols across all 8 languages to identify tissue-regenerative approaches vs compensation strategies.

## Analysis Steps

### 1. Tissue regeneration vs compensation
- **REGENERATIVE**: Exercises with objective laxity reduction, increased ligament CSA, reduced translation
- **COMPENSATION**: Proprioceptive training, muscle strengthening around lax joints, activity modification
- Separate into two lists
- Only focus on regenerative protocols for final recommendations

### 2. Mechanical loading patterns
- **Eccentric loading protocols**: Which show tissue changes?
- **Isometric holds**: Duration and intensity for ligament stimulation
- **Progressive overload**: How to advance load for connective tissue adaptation
- **Load parameters**: Intensity/frequency/volume for tissue vs muscle

### 3. Eastern vs Western approaches
- **Chinese**: 站桩功 (standing pole), 八段錦 (eight brocades), 易筋经 - tissue regeneration evidence?
- **Japanese**: Traditional rehabilitation methods
- **Korean**: Acupotomy + exercise combinations
- **Western**: Eccentric protocols, SMoC-Wrist framework
- Which have objective evidence of tissue changes?

### 4. Myofibroblast activation evidence
- Which exercises/loading patterns stimulate contractile fibroblasts?
- Mechanisms documented
- Success rates for laxity reduction

### 5. Wrist vs spine specific
- **Wrist**: Scapholunate stabilization protocols, TFCC strengthening, carpal alignment
- **Spine**: Thoracolumbar T11-L2 specific, multifidus + ligament training, lateral/rotational stability
- Different progressions needed

### 6. IL-6 genotype considerations
- Which progressions minimize flare-up risk?
- Recovery protocols for high baseline inflammation
- How to dose exercise for tissue remodeling WITHOUT chronic inflammation
- Anti-inflammatory timing (when to use, when to avoid)

### 7. Progression frameworks
- Beginner → Intermediate → Advanced pathways
- When to advance (pain thresholds, stability markers)
- Typical timelines for tissue changes (not symptom improvement)
- Plateau troubleshooting

## Output file
**exercise_analysis.md** with sections:
1. Tissue Regeneration Protocols (use these - objective evidence of structural changes)
2. Regional Approaches (Eastern vs Western, what works)
3. Myofibroblast Activation (mechanical loading that triggers tissue contraction)
4. Wrist-Specific Programs
5. Spine-Specific Programs (T11-L2 thoracolumbar focus)
6. IL-6-Appropriate Progressions (minimize flare-ups)
7. Progression Framework (beginner to advanced with timelines)
